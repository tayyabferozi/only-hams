                Sadly, before he had time to snort the location, he died,
                leaving behind the story of the missing fortune. This quickly
                became an old pig’s ‘tail’ passed down from generation to

                This pig in question is known as{" "}

                the leader of a local swine syndicate, who runs the underbelly

              <p>
                He wasn’t always like this, having been the runt of his litter
                and ruthlessly bullied by his piglet siblings, he grew up
                wanting-revenge on all those that had taunted him, you could say

              His plan was simple, take the land from the pigs at what ever
              cost! ‘leave no stone unturned’ he oinked mercilessly to the
              wolves.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although the stereotype of wolves would have you thinking they
              were ferocious beasts, actually these wolves had a softer side.
              Eager to please the Hogfather, they formed their own plan, which
              was to go door to door offering the pigs money for their homes.
              They knew that the pigs would be fearful of them, so as to not be
              intimidating, decided on a disguise.

              Ever heard the saying{" "}
              <span className="text-blue">‘wolf in sheep’s clothing’</span>…yep
              that’s what disguise they decided on. The pigs loved their
              community and their houses and declined the offer from the wolves.
              Pigsty to pigsty, house to house, high rise tower to high rise
              tower they went, but not one little pig wanted to sell.

                The Hogfather was getting inpatient, and decided he needed to

                slept contently in their beds, the Hogfather initiated his plan.
                The next morning, everyone woke up to a loud squealing and to
                discover a single link of sausages left menacingly on their
