                    These pigs NEED your help. Every passing day without minting
                    one of these Pigs, and helping to beef up security, the
                    chances that the Hogfather turns another little pig into a
                    link of sausages, soars!
                    <br />
                    As well as adopting your digital friend, there are a number
                    of benefits to minting a Hamton Pig, including adopting a
                    real pig, supplying over 17000 meals to hungry children,
                    giving large amounts to charity, as well as being in with a
                    chance to win ETH in our many planned giveaways.

                    Each unique Hamton Pig NFT is a randomized computer
                    generated art picture, with its traits and original picture
                    data stored on IPFS, which cannot be tampered with. 50 of
                    the 10,000 Hamton Pig NFT’s are NOT randomized and are
                    hand-crafted, they are main characters from the story, or
                    special themed Pigs intended for giveaway marketing
                    purposes, or retained for members of the team.

                    What a Boar-ing question. The cost to Mint an Pig is 0.08
                    ETH and gas fee per transaction. If you are looking to mint
                    more than 1 Pig, then make sure you do it in the same
                    transaction to save yourself on gas fees.
